# Project-2

# Description
The game is a simulation of climbing in which you have a certain energy to start with, and the higher you climb, your energy decrease. The height of the mountain varies from the path you take. If your energy burns out, you will fall. Your goal is to find the best path for reaching the top. You get a max score if you save the most energy.

# How It Works
The wall is essentially the only avenue of input available to the player. The wall will have handholds. These handholds will be the only interactive pieces, allowing players to grip and hoist themselves. We could then institute either a high score system, based on climbing an infinite wall and judging maximum height reached, or a difficulty system, in which we either hard code several walls or have progressively harder sets of handholds randomly generated. Some of the handholds will be infected with COVID-19 and visible and some will be hidden. The player has to avoid these and reach the maximum height.

# COVID:
There are three different types of handholds on the game. 

- Normal Handholds: 
The player has to use these to reach the heighest point. 

- Visible Covid Handholds:
These handholds are visible to the player and the player has to avoid them to reach the maximum height. Touching one may readuce your health or height you have climbed. 

- Invisible Covid Handholds:
These handholds are invisible to the player and the player has to avoid them to reach the maximum height. Touching one may readuce your health or height you have climbed. 

# Menu:

The menu was created by importing an asset from the Asset Store. The actual asset is tailored for a RPG game. The following changes were made to the asset to make it compatible with our game: 

- The Extras Section was removed from the actual menu. 
- Settings menu was removed since it involved details regarding the RPG game. 
- The audio on clicking the buttons has been changed. 
- Background music has been edited out to suit the game. 
- Since the buttons in the menu are co- related, the script was edited to make the functionality better suited to our game as deleting the buttons was not possible (created stagnant menu with no option to resume or exit game).
- The theme was edited.

# Mid Review Feedback:

- How would orientation work on this?

- Big Chungus?

- Will there be hand tracking?

- isn't the appeal of rock climbing physical exertion? sorry if i missed it, but will the user just be waving their arms around?
