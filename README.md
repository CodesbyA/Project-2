# Project-2

# Description
The game is a simulation of climbing in which you have a certain energy to start with, and the higher you climb, your energy decrease. The height of the mountain varies from the path you take. If your energy burns out, you will fall. Your goal is to find the best path for reaching the top. You get a max score if you save the most energy.

# How It Works
•	The wall is essentially the only avenue of input available to the player.
•	The wall will have handholds. These handholds will be the only interactive pieces, allowing players to grip and hoist themselves.
•	We could then institute either a high score system, based on climbing an infinite wall and judging maximum height reached, or a difficulty system, in which we either hard code several walls or have progressively harder sets of handholds randomly generated.
•	Some of the handholds will be infected with COVID-19 and visible and some will be hidden. The player has to avoid these and reach the maximum height.
